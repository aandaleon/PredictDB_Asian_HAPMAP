##Steps for new Pipeline
#1 Copy scripts from Github
#2 Edit genotype files to pull the correct columns and have the right headers
#3 Use scripts to separate the genotype and snp files
#4 Edit text files
#5 Edit pop_train_combos.R
#6 Edit gtex_v7_nested_cv_elnet.R
#7 Edit pop_train_models_combos.pbs
#8 Edit and run train_models_jobs_combo.sh
#9 Edit and run make_dbs.R
#10 Edit and run filter_dbs.R

##5/31/18
awk -v OFS='\t' '{print $1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$7}' Asian_22_annot2.txt > Asian_22_annot.txt
##pulls the correct columns from the genotype file

head -n 1 /home/jennifer/path/Asian_22_annot.txt > /home/home/jennifer/path/header      #pulls header from one of the files
grep -v Chr /home/jennifer/path/Asian_1-22_annotation.txt> /home/jennifer/path/p             #removes all lines that start with 'Chr' and puts into dummy file 'p' change based on header/type of file you're concatenating 
cat /home/jennifer/path/header /home/jennifer/path/p > /home/jennifer/path/Asian_1-22_final_annotation.txt    #places header on top of 'p' and outputs to final file
##create a new header for the files to match the pipeline

##Notes: Keep 10 pcs and 10 PEER factors for now; use annot2.py and genotype2.py to separate the files
##Problems: There is a difference between the genotype and snp file for chromosome 12; figure out how to filter out the difference in R; also noted that most of the individual pops did not match in terms of the combined file, so have to recat them all

##6/1/18
##look at one specific line in the file
sed -n 'Xp' filename

##how to look at one row
awk '{print $1}' Asian_snp.chr15.txt > head3
awk '{print $3}' Asian_annot.chr15.txt > test4

##remove the extra snp in the snp file that is not in the genotype file
A <- read.table("/home/jennifer/new_PredDB/elastic_net/prepare_data/genotypes/head1", header= T)
B <- read.table("/home/jennifer/new_PredDB/elastic_net/prepare_data/genotypes/head2", header = T)
colnames(A) <- "rsid"
setdiff(B$rsid, A$rsid)
##chr12 difference [1] "12_10574438_T_C_b37"
C<- read.table("/home/jennifer/new_PredDB/elastic_net/prepare_data/genotypes/head3", header= T)
D<- read.table("/home/jennifer/new_PredDB/elastic_net/prepare_data/genotypes/head4", header = T)
colnames(D) <- "rsid"
which(B$rsid =="12_10574438_T_C_b37")
##find which row number is different, BUT have to add one because does not include the header

##remove row 13557 in Chr12 snp file
sed -i '13557d' Asian_snp.chr12.txt 

##Notes:remove row 13557 in the snp file for Chr12 and remove row 69068 in both the genotype file and the snp file for Chr15
##Problems:edit make_dbs_jenny.R with the correct file paths!! 
##things to do: read paper and edit slide share for lab meeting 6/6/18, finish mulcahy paperwork and filter dbs

##6/6/18

##Problems: need to correct the pcs files in order to have the correct columns - remove column 3

##6/8/18
##created a bash script to make snp files and annot files for each individual population
##Problems:hadto rename one of the headers from id to rsid, then must combine each file, pull the correct columns from the file, rename the header, then split

##6/10/18
##Problems: issues with merging the snp files correctly, so causing an error when trying to split them using split_genotypes2.py, must recombine and fix
##can I just cat them all?? Try on Tuesday

##6/12/18
##to change the header of the file, use:
tail -n +2 CHB_1-22_final.annot.txt > nohead
cat header nohead > CHB_1-22_use_annot.txt
##dont know why, but when use grep, it removes about 21 lines for some reason
